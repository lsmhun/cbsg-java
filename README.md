## Examples

```
Matrices promote the Growth Hackers across and beyond the cubes; this is why 
expertise in the digital age calls for silos. The sphere promotes our cubes 
within the community, whereas a matrix 24/7 reenergizes the resources within 
the community. There is no alternative to sphere. Matrices revolutionise 
an organization, as a Tier 1 company. In the same time, the diversities 
proactively reintermediates our cube up, down and across the matrix. 
Matrix in the digital age calls for sphere.

Cubes will be a thing of the past over the next decade and be fully 
replaced with intra-company, enhanced motions.
